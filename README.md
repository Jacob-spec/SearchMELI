## SearchML v1.3

This script allows you to input items and their prices on a google spreadsheet and check their price regularly. 
It is intended to be run periodically, and if anything is found marching the criteria another spreadsheet will be updated and an email will be sent to you
UpdateML.py is a tool to update the items you already have quicker

# Set-up

1-Download the repository

2-YouÂ´ll need a google service account. It that can be created by following the steps in this link.
https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html#enable-api-access

3-Put the .json file you downloaded in the previous step in the same directory you have the scripts and replace %service_account.json% in both python files with the name of the downloaded one.

4-Open the json file and look for the service account's email. It should look something like this: mercadolibrebot@mercadolibrebot-275920.iam.gserviceaccount.com

5-Open the .xlsx that came with the scripts in spreadsheets and share them with the email from the last step. If you don't change the names, you shouldn't have any problems with the calls. 

6-If you are from other countries other than Argentina, you need to change the site code from the API link. If you are from Brazil for example, replace MLA with MLB.

(Optional)If you don't want to use the email feature, just leave the send_mail() call commented.

7-Set up the send_email method to receive a notification via email. Replace %from%, %password% and %to% with your personal information from your google account. You can either use a secondary account to send the emails or send them to yourself.

# Use

1-Fill the ItemsML sheet with the searches you want to make. The item field is the textual search in MercadoLibre, the low_price is the price the script will below, and the floor_price is the lower limit of the search, in case you need one. The forbidden and required are optional. They are meant for words that should or should not appear in the title, and are used to narrow the search parameters to the items intended. Condition takes either "new" or "used" (without quotation marks) or nothing if all results are desired.

2-Find a way to keep the script running periodically. Daily, hourly, as you wish. I can recommend a free account on pythonanywhere.com that allows you to schedule 1 task daily in the cloud.

3-If the script finds anything, it will appear in ResultsML with its link. 

## Hope its useful to you. I'm open to any kind of suggestions and critics.

Thank You
